## Getting started

### 1. Get the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nasirabbas827/FinalCode-SmartHealth-Sameer-Waleed.git
cd FinalCode-SmartHealth-Sameer-Waleed
```

### 2. Prepare Python

Create an isolated environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it with `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows Command Prompt, or `source .venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux.

No requirements file is included. The inspected Python imports indicate these dependencies as a starting point:

```bash
python -m pip install Django pandas plotly reportlab numpy scikit-learn
```

Dependency versions are not pinned in this repository.

### 3. Configure and run

Review [`myproject/settings.py`](myproject/settings.py) for database, media, and any email configuration. Use a local copy of the supplied database when available.

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/. If you need a Django administration account, run `python manage.py createsuperuser`. Application-specific user roles may be managed separately.

Review the application's email/API configuration and supply your own service credentials for integrations you intend to use.
